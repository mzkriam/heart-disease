Machine learning (ML) applications are dramatically changing the healthcare industry and are essential for medicine because it can find patterns in large data sets and facilitate the identification of diagnostic indicators related to risks or diseases in many medical applications. The results of the work during the project can be divided into three stages. The first is the theoretical study of heart disease and artificial intelligence and the relationship between them. The second is an explanation of machine learning, its algorithms, types, mechanism of action, and the stages of developing an automated learning project. The third is an explanation of the Python language and the software offices used, NumPy - Pandas - Matplotlib. At the end of the project, there is a model. Machine learning capable of predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms and then generating a graphical interface for the system.
